# Comparison-of-Models-using-R
One Data Set with multiple Algorithms

Steps followed:
1. Import all the required libraries
2. Read data set and create pandas Data Frame
3. Recode decision variable
4. Create Input feature matrix and dependent variable (X and Y)
5. divide data into Train and Test samples
6. Run different algorithms on the train data and validate on test data
7. Capture Accuracy levels of each model/algorithm
8. Calculate the performance of each algorithm (TPR and FPR)
9. Plot ROC curves all models into One single plot
